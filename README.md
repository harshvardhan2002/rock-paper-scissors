This Game comes in 4 modes:

1. Beginner
2. Intermediate
3. Expert
4. Super Hard

Beginner is only doing it randomly. Intermediate uses a particular AI Algorithm based on common player psychology. Expert uses a butchering of the Markov Chain Concept to allow the Machine to adapt to player strategies and accurately predict their next pick. Super hard is well... Super hard.
